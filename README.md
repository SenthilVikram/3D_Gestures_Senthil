# 3D Gestures Project

## SOC Project - Task 1

In this task, transfer learning of popular CNN Architectures is used to classify hand gestures.
You can find the dataset link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14MgJdRSxVCNwpUHXJQ_7NXPQFT-Oz4CB?usp=sharing)

Total 5 classes are used to and entire code is written in PyTorch. 

### CNN Architectures used:
* VGG16
* Densenet121
* Resnet-50
* Googlenet
* wide-Resnet-50-2

## SOC Project - Task 2

In this task, I classified gestures from an input video accessed from drive. I classified each frame after an approx time interval in changing the gesture. Resnet50 model used in task 1 was also used here to classify frames in video.
A sample output of a classified frame would look like this below
